***Inverting Op-Amp Adder Circuit using LTspice***


Project Overview

This project demonstrates an inverting op-amp adder circuit simulated using LTspice. The op-amp used is the universal opamp from LTspice's component library. This circuit adds two input voltages, with the output being the inverted sum of the inputs. The circuit is designed to show the behavior of an ideal op-amp in an inverting configuration.

Circuit Description


The inverting op-amp adder circuit has the following components:



1.Voltage Sources (V1,V2,V3): Provide input signals to the inverting op-amp adder.

2.Resistors (R1, R2, R3, Rf): The resistors set the input and feedback levels of the circuit. All resistors are 10kΩ.

3.R1 ,R2 and R3 are the input resistors connected to the voltage sources.

4.Rf is the feedback resistor that connects the output to the inverting terminal.

5.Op-Amp (universal opamp): This is the ideal op-amp model used in the circuit. It doesn't require supply voltages.

6.Output (Vout): The output voltage is the inverted sum of the inputs, calculated using the formula:


V(out)=-R(f)[V1/R1+V2/R2+V3/R3]
